  <Description>This module explores advanced AI engineering techniques for building reliable, context-aware systems. Learners will implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground LLM outputs in factual knowledge bases, and design multi-agent systems where specialized AI agents collaborate on complex tasks. The module emphasizes practical skills in vector search, embedding models, agent orchestration, and evaluation strategies that are essential for production AI applications in 2025.</Description>

  <LearningObjectives>
    <LearningObjective name="Building Production RAG Systems">
      Learners will design and implement end-to-end RAG pipelines that retrieve relevant information from knowledge bases and generate accurate, cited responses. They'll gain hands-on experience with vector databases, embedding models, chunking strategies, and hybrid search techniques. They'll understand how to evaluate retrieval quality, prevent hallucinations through grounding, and optimize for both accuracy and performance in real-world applications.
    </LearningObjective>
    <LearningObjective name="Multi-Agent System Architecture">
      Learners will architect systems where multiple specialized AI agents work together to solve complex problems that would be difficult for a single agent. They'll understand different coordination patterns (orchestrator-worker, role-based collaboration, agent debate), implement communication protocols between agents, and handle task decomposition and delegation. They'll recognize emergent behaviors in agent collectives and learn to design systems that balance autonomy with reliability.
    </LearningObjective>
    <LearningObjective name="Evaluation and Iteration of AI Systems">
      Learners will develop systematic approaches to evaluating AI system quality beyond simple demos. For RAG systems, they'll measure retrieval precision, answer groundedness, and citation accuracy. For agent systems, they'll assess task completion, decision quality, and coordination effectiveness. They'll create evaluation datasets, implement metrics, and use findings to iteratively improve their systems—developing the engineering discipline required for production AI.
    </LearningObjective>
    <LearningObjective name="Working with Modern AI Infrastructure">
      Learners will gain practical experience with the infrastructure layer of AI applications: vector databases for semantic search, embedding APIs and local models, agent frameworks for orchestration, and observability tools for debugging. They'll understand trade-offs between managed services and self-hosted solutions, optimize for cost and latency, and make informed decisions about technology choices based on project requirements.
    </LearningObjective>

  <ResearchTopics>
    <PrimaryTopics>
      <Topic name="RAG Architecture and Modern Patterns">
        <SubTopic name="Understanding RAG fundamentals and evolution">
          - Research what RAG is and why it's become essential: combining LLMs with external knowledge for accurate, up-to-date, auditable answers
          - Find case studies of RAG in production: how companies like Microsoft, financial services, and legal AI use retrieval to ground responses
          - Understand the difference between RAG, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering—when to use each approach
          - Look into 2025 innovations: adaptive retrieval (systems that adjust strategy based on query), self-correcting RAG (SELF-RAG that critiques its own retrievals), and agentic retrieval patterns
          - Key insight to find: RAG isn't just about accuracy—it's about transparency, traceability, and keeping AI systems accountable
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Hybrid search and advanced retrieval techniques">
          - Research hybrid search: combining vector similarity (semantic meaning) with keyword search (BM25 or full-text)
          - Why hybrid matters: vector search finds conceptually similar content, keyword search catches exact terms/names
          - Explore query augmentation: rewriting or expanding user queries before retrieval to improve results
          - Look into reranking (L2 ranking): using a second model to reorder retrieved results by relevance
          - Find examples of when each technique helps: hybrid for broad domains, pure vector for semantic tasks, reranking for precision
          - Pro tip from research: "start with hybrid search and layer in advanced methods as complexity grows"
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Chunking strategies and context management">
          - Research document chunking: breaking long documents into smaller pieces for embedding and retrieval
          - Explore trade-offs: small chunks (precise but may lack context) vs. large chunks (more context but less precise)
          - Look into overlapping chunks, semantic chunking (splitting at natural boundaries), and metadata enrichment
          - Understand token limits: how much retrieved context can fit in an LLM prompt (4k-128k tokens depending on model)
          - Find guidance on optimal chunk sizes: research suggests paragraph-level (~100-512 tokens) often works well
          - Advanced: contextual compression techniques that summarize retrieved chunks before feeding to LLM
        </SubTopic>
      </Topic>

      <Topic name="Vector Databases and Semantic Search">
        <SubTopic name="Vector database landscape in 2025">
          - Research at least 2-3 vector database options and understand their trade-offs
          - Chroma: open-source, easy to run locally, ideal for prototyping but limited scalability (single-node)
          - Pinecone: fully managed cloud service, serverless option available, good for production but requires API costs
          - Qdrant: open-source with strong performance (research shows 4x RPS gains), supports filtering and hybrid search
          - Weaviate: schema-based, supports GraphQL, good for knowledge graphs but performance has lagged competitors
          - Consider: local vs. cloud (cost, latency, data privacy), scaling characteristics, and ease of setup for your project
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Indexing, querying, and performance">
          - How to index documents: convert text to embeddings, store vectors with metadata, build similarity search index
          - Perform similarity search: query vector → find k nearest neighbors → return most similar documents
          - Understand distance metrics: cosine similarity (most common for text), Euclidean distance, dot product
          - Research indexing algorithms: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is standard for approximate nearest neighbor search
          - Performance considerations: indexing time, query latency, memory usage, and accuracy trade-offs
          - Try a tiny example: index 5-10 sentences, query one, see what comes back and why
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Metadata filtering and hybrid capabilities">
          - Beyond pure vector search: filtering by metadata (date, category, author, etc.) before or after similarity search
          - Hybrid search implementation: combine vector results with keyword search results, merge with weighted scores
          - Pre-filtering vs. post-filtering: applying metadata filters before vector search (faster) vs. after (more flexible)
          - Research shows hybrid search is now recommended as starting point for most enterprise applications
          - Practical example: "Find documents about climate change published after 2023" requires both semantic understanding and date filtering
        </SubTopic>
      </Topic>

      <Topic name="Embedding Models and Semantic Representation">
        <SubTopic name="Choosing embedding models in 2025">
          - Research current embedding model landscape: OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small/large), open-source (Sentence-BERT, E5, BGE)
          - Important: OpenAI's ada-002 and text-embedding-3 models deprecate October 2025—plan for alternatives
          - Open-source options: models on MTEB leaderboard (Hugging Face) show comparable quality to proprietary models
          - Trade-offs: API models (easy, high-quality, ongoing cost) vs. local models (free after download, need GPU/compute)
          - Dimensionality: larger embeddings (1536-3072d) capture more nuance but cost more storage; smaller (384-768d) often sufficient
          - Use MTEB leaderboard to compare models on retrieval, classification, and clustering tasks
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="How embeddings work and semantic similarity">
          - Understand embedding space: high-dimensional vector space where semantically similar texts are close together
          - Cosine similarity: measures angle between vectors (0=orthogonal, 1=identical direction), standard for text
          - Why it works: models trained on massive text data learn to place "dog" near "puppy" and "canine" in vector space
          - Experiment: embed several related and unrelated sentences, calculate similarities, see which cluster together
          - Understand limitations: embeddings capture semantic meaning but may miss exact keyword matches (why hybrid search helps)
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Domain-specific and multilingual considerations">
          - General vs. domain-specific embeddings: general models (trained on web data) vs. specialized (BioBERT for medicine, CodeBERT for code)
          - When domain-specific matters: highly technical fields where general models miss subtle distinctions
          - Multilingual embeddings: models that map multiple languages into same vector space (e.g., "dog" in English near "hund" in German)
          - Cost considerations: research shows embedding costs have dropped to commodity pricing (&lt;$0.02/M tokens in 2025)
          - Practical advice: start with general model (OpenAI 3-small or open-source equivalent), only specialize if needed
        </SubTopic>
      </Topic>

      <Topic name="Prompting Strategies for RAG">
        <SubTopic name="Formatting prompts with retrieved context">
          - Research effective prompt structures: "Answer using only the following context: [context]. Question: [question]"
          - Instruct the model to say "I don't know" if information isn't in the retrieved documents
          - Use structured formats: present each retrieved document with clear markers (Document 1:, Document 2:, etc.)
          - System prompts for RAG: set expectations about using context, not hallucinating, and citing sources
          - Find community examples: LangChain prompt hub has RAG-specific prompts to study and adapt
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Citation and source attribution">
          - How to get the LLM to cite sources: explicitly ask in prompt ("Include which document supports your answer")
          - Structured output approaches: ask for JSON with "answer" and "source_documents" fields
          - Passage-level citation: have model quote specific excerpts from retrieved text
          - Why citations matter: transparency, trust, ability to verify, and debugging when answers are wrong
          - Research shows: proper citation techniques are critical for high-stakes domains (legal, medical, financial)
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Handling context window limitations">
          - Token limits vary by model: GPT-3.5 (4k), GPT-4 (8k-128k), Claude (200k)—but more tokens = higher cost and latency
          - Strategies when retrieved docs exceed limit: truncate, summarize, or retrieve fewer but more relevant chunks
          - Context window management: prioritize most relevant chunks, consider recency, use reranking to select best subset
          - Research "lost in the middle" problem: models sometimes ignore information in middle of very long contexts
          - Practical guideline: even with large context windows, focused relevant context (1k-4k tokens) often works better than dumping everything
        </SubTopic>
      </Topic>

      <Topic name="Evaluating RAG Systems">
        <SubTopic name="Metrics for retrieval and generation quality">
          - Retrieval metrics: Precision@k (how many retrieved docs are relevant), Recall@k (did we find all relevant docs), MRR (mean reciprocal rank)
          - Generation metrics: answer correctness, groundedness (is answer supported by retrieved context), relevance to question
          - End-to-end metrics: can the system correctly answer questions from a test set?
          - Research frameworks: RAGAS (RAG Assessment), TruLens, and other evaluation libraries
          - Industry practice: create evaluation datasets with known questions and expected answers for systematic testing
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Creating evaluation datasets and test cases">
          - Build a test set: 20-50 representative questions with known correct answers from your knowledge base
          - Include edge cases: questions with no answer in docs, ambiguous questions, questions requiring multiple documents
          - Human evaluation: have people rate answer quality, correctness, and citation accuracy
          - Automated evaluation: use another LLM as judge to score answers (LLM-as-judge pattern)
          - Iterate: use evaluation results to improve chunking, retrieval, or prompting strategies
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Debugging and failure analysis">
          - Common failure modes: wrong chunks retrieved, relevant chunks not retrieved, model ignores context, incorrect citations
          - Debugging retrieval: manually inspect what chunks are retrieved for test queries—are they actually relevant?
          - Debugging generation: is the model following instructions? Is the context clear enough?
          - Observability tools: log queries, retrieved chunks, and generated answers for analysis
          - Systematic improvement: identify patterns in failures, hypothesize fixes, test on evaluation set
        </SubTopic>
      </Topic>

      <Topic name="AI Agents and Function Calling">
        <SubTopic name="Function calling and tool use">
          - Research OpenAI's function calling: define functions with names, parameters, descriptions; model outputs JSON to call them
          - How it works: model decides when to call a function vs. respond directly, structures arguments as JSON
          - Best practices: clear function descriptions, constrained parameter schemas, error handling for invalid calls
          - Beyond OpenAI: Anthropic's tool use, open models with function calling (Mistral, Llama), framework abstractions (LangChain tools)
          - Practical examples: calculator tool, web search tool, database query tool, API call tool
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Agent reasoning loops and ReAct pattern">
          - Understand agent loop: Observe → Reason → Act → Observe (repeat until task complete)
          - ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): agent thinks step-by-step, decides what tool to use, observes result, repeats
          - Research examples: LangChain agents, AutoGPT's task loop, BabyAGI's planning system
          - Challenges: agents can get stuck in loops, make irrelevant tool calls, or fail to make progress
          - Safeguards: max iterations limit, require agent to explain reasoning, human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
        </SubTopic>
        <SubTopic name="Agent frameworks and ecosystem">
          - Research major frameworks: LangChain (modular, extensive integrations), LangGraph (graph-based control flow)
          - Microsoft ecosystem: AutoGen (now merged into Agent Framework), Semantic Kernel (enterprise .NET focus)
          - Explore simple examples from documentation: basic agent that can search web and answer questions
          - Understand what frameworks provide: abstractions for tools, memory, planning, and orchestration
          - Consider: frameworks accelerate development but add complexity—when to use vs. build from scratch?
        </SubTopic>
      </Topic>

      <Topic name="Tool Design and Agent Safety">
        <SubTopic name="Designing effective tools for agents">
          - Principles: tools should be focused, have clear purposes, return structured data, handle errors gracefully
          - Common tool types: information retrieval (search, database query), actions (send email, create file), computation (calculator, code execution)
          - Tool descriptions matter: agent relies on description to decide when to use tool—be specific about what it does and when to use it
          - Error handling: what if tool returns no results, times out, or errors? Agent needs clear feedback to recover

        <SubTopic name="Constraining agent behavior">
          - Why constraints matter: unconstrained agents can waste API calls, take unwanted actions, or get stuck
          - Strategies: limit available tools, require justification before actions, set iteration/cost budgets, human approval for critical actions
          - Prompt engineering for safety: instruct agent on boundaries, when to ask for help, what actions are prohibited
          - Observability: log all agent actions, tool calls, and reasoning for audit trails
          - Research shows: minor prompt changes can cause large behavioral changes in agents—careful testing is essential

        <Task>Build a chatbot that provides reliable, cited answers based on a provided knowledge base using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.</Task>
        <Focus>Implementing embeddings, vector search, and hybrid retrieval to ground LLM outputs in facts. Learn to build a pipeline where user queries trigger document retrieval followed by an LLM response that cites retrieved information, mitigating hallucinations and ensuring transparency.</Focus>
        <Criteria>
          - Build a chatbot that answers user queries based on a specific knowledge base (company docs, FAQs, technical documentation, or any domain corpus)
          - Implement end-to-end RAG pipeline: document ingestion → chunking → embedding → vector storage → retrieval → generation
          - Deliver answers with references to source material, ensuring users can verify information
          - The bot must fetch relevant information from the provided data and use it to formulate answers, rather than relying purely on the LLM's internal knowledge
          - Handle cases where information isn't found gracefully (e.g., "I don't have information about that in the knowledge base")
          - Demonstrate measurable improvement over a baseline (e.g., LLM without RAG) through evaluation on test questions
        </Criteria>
        <Skills>
          <Skill name="Building end-to-end RAG pipelines">
            - Create complete system: user query → retrieval → context formatting → LLM generation → response with citations
            - Document ingestion: load documents from various formats (PDF, Markdown, HTML, plain text)
            - Chunking strategy: split documents into appropriately-sized pieces (typically paragraph-level, 100-512 tokens)
            - Embedding generation: convert chunks to vectors using embedding model (OpenAI, Sentence-BERT, or open-source alternatives)
            - Vector database setup: index embeddings in Chroma, Pinecone, Qdrant, or similar
            - Query processing: convert user question to embedding, retrieve top-k similar chunks

            - Query augmentation: rewrite or expand queries to improve retrieval (e.g., adding synonyms, clarifying intent)
            - Reranking: use second-stage model to reorder retrieved results by relevance before feeding to LLM
            - Metadata filtering: allow filtering by date, category, author, or other attributes before or after vector search
            - Understand trade-offs: pure vector (semantic), pure keyword (exact match), hybrid (best of both)
            - Optimize retrieval: experiment with number of chunks retrieved (k), similarity thresholds, and ranking methods
          </Skill>

            - Handle edge cases: no relevant documents found, conflicting information, ambiguous queries
            - Teach the model to say "I don't know" when information isn't in the knowledge base
            - Provide passage-level citations: quote specific excerpts that support the answer
            - Build transparency: users should be able to click through to source documents to verify claims
            - Understand why this matters: trust, accountability, debugging, and meeting requirements in high-stakes domains
          </Skill>
          <Skill name="Evaluation and systematic improvement">
            - Create evaluation dataset: 20-50 test questions with known correct answers from your knowledge base
            - Measure retrieval quality: are the right documents being retrieved? (Precision@k, Recall@k)
            - Measure answer quality: is the answer correct? Is it grounded in retrieved context? Are citations accurate?
            - Use LLM-as-judge: have another LLM score answer correctness, relevance, and groundedness
            - Analyze failure modes: categorize what went wrong (bad retrieval, model ignored context, incorrect citation)
            - Iterate systematically: change one thing (chunk size, retrieval method, prompt), re-evaluate, measure improvement
            - Document learnings: what chunking strategy worked best? How many chunks to retrieve? What prompt format?

  <Notes>
    <Note>
      The 2025 AI engineering landscape has matured significantly. RAG is no longer experimental—it's production infrastructure with established patterns (hybrid search, reranking, citation). Multi-agent systems have moved from research demos to enterprise adoption, with clear framework choices and architectural patterns. This module reflects that maturity while acknowledging the field is still evolving rapidly.
    </Note>
    <Note>
      Evaluation is emphasized throughout because it's often overlooked by beginners but critical for real systems. Learners should understand that demos are easy, but building systems that reliably work requires systematic evaluation and iteration. The module encourages creating test sets early and using them to drive improvements.
    </Note>
    <Note>
      Cost considerations are practical concerns for learners with limited budgets. Guidance emphasizes free/cheap options (Chroma locally, open-source embeddings, free tiers) while explaining when paid services (Pinecone, OpenAI embeddings) might be worth it. The goal is to make the module accessible while teaching production-relevant trade-offs.
    </Note>
    <Note>
      The project twists are designed to push conceptual thinking rather than just adding features. "The Unreliable Narrator" forces thinking about ambiguity and multiple interpretations. "The Helpful Saboteur" explores AI as a thinking partner rather than just an answer machine. These twists make projects more interesting and pedagogically valuable.
