Summary of Strategic Changes v0.0.1 → v0.0.3
===

Arc 1: Foundations - Evolution with Reordering

Philosophy Evolution:
- FROM: Theory-first (understand before doing)
- TO: Theory-through-practice (understand while doing)

Module Progression Changes:
1. Theoretical model study → Practical LLM understanding + tools
2. Advanced prompt mastery → Fundamental prompt competency
3. Low-level integration → Framework-based development
4. AI-enhanced workflows → Evaluation & responsible AI

Key Strategic Shifts:
1. Immediate Applicability: Learners use AI tools from day 1
2. Framework Focus: Emphasis on LangChain vs raw patterns
3. Quality First: Evaluation/testing moved into foundational arc
4. Practical Depth: "Fundamentals" replaces "Mastery"

Arc 2: Complete Replacement

Philosophy Replacement:
- FROM: Agentic Systems (autonomous problem-solvers)
- TO: RAG & Knowledge Systems (grounded knowledge retrieval)

This isn't an evolution - it's a different subject matter:
- Agent autonomy → Knowledge grounding
- Tool use → Semantic search
- Planning frameworks → Retrieval pipelines
- Memory systems → Caching strategies
- Multi-agent coordination → Production operations

Pedagogical Implications:

v0.0.1 Vision: Train engineers to build advanced autonomous agent systems
- Deep agent architectures
- Sophisticated planning
- Complex coordination
- Cutting-edge AI systems

v0.0.3 Vision: Train engineers to build reliable knowledge-enhanced applications
- RAG fundamentals
- Production pipelines
- Operational excellence
- Enterprise-ready systems

The shift reflects a market reality check: most organizations need RAG systems (grounding AI in proprietary knowledge) more urgently than they need autonomous agents. The course now teaches the techniques that have immediate enterprise applicability.

Where Did Agents Go?

Agents didn't disappear - they moved to Arc 3 (modules condensed from 4→4 dedicated modules to integrated coverage alongside other advanced topics). This repositioning treats agents as one advanced technique among several, rather than a foundational pillar deserving an entire arc.

Key Philosophical Change:

v0.0.1: "AI Engineering = Building Autonomous Systems"
v0.0.3: "AI Engineering = Grounding AI in Knowledge + Multiple Techniques"

The revised course is more balanced, practical, and aligned with 2025 industry needs where RAG is ubiquitous and agents are still emerging.
