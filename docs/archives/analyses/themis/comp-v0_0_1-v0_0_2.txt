Summary of Strategic Changes

Arc 1 Philosophy Shift

Original (2025-10-15-001): Theory → Practice progression
1. Understand models first
2. Master prompting
3. Learn integration
4. Apply to development

Revised (2025-10-17-002): Practice → Theory progression
1. Use AI tools immediately
2. Learn prompting systematically
3. Understand ML foundations
4. Integrate APIs properly

Arc 2 Complete Reframe

Original (2025-10-15-001): Advanced agentic systems focus
- Autonomous agents
- Planning and reasoning
- Memory systems
- Multi-agent coordination
- Audience: Engineers building sophisticated agent systems

Revised (2025-10-17-002): Practical application development focus
- Application architecture
- Conversation management
- Tool-using agents (simplified)
- UX and testing
- Audience: Engineers building complete AI products

Key Pedagogical Changes

1. Immediate Applicability: Revised version prioritizes tools learners can use from day 1
2. Scaffolded Complexity: ML fundamentals now come after hands-on experience
3. Product Focus: From AI-as-agent to AI-as-feature in broader applications
4. Practical Scope: Agents are one module, not an entire arc's focus
5. User-Centric: Added UX/testing module reflects product development reality

The revised course appears designed for developers who want to build AI products, while the original was more oriented toward those building advanced AI
systems.
