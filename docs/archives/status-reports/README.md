# Status Reports

## Current State

The "thorough interrogation" style status reports have been deprecated in favour of the more actionable roadmap documents. For current project status, see:

- **[Rhea Roadmap](../roadmaps/Rhea-MVP.md)** - Overall project status with "Next Up" and "Recent Wins"
- **[Metis Roadmap](../roadmaps/mvp-modules/Metis-MVP.md)** - Module generator status
- **[Themis Roadmap](../roadmaps/mvp-modules/Themis-MVP.md)** - Course builder status
- **[Tethys Roadmap](../roadmaps/mvp-modules/Tethys-MVP.md)** - Arc management status (not yet started)
- **[Thalassa Roadmap](../roadmaps/mvp-modules/Thalassa-MVP.md)** - Module review status (not yet started)

## Archived Reports

Historical status reports are available in `/docs/archives/status-reports/` for reference.

## Note

The placeholder Metis, Themis, and Tethys status files can be removed. Their content is better represented in the roadmaps, which are actively maintained and provide actionable task tracking.
