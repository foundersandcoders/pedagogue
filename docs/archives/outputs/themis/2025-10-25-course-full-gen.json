You don't need to be a Python expert to build AI applications—many successful AI engineers learned Python specifically for this purpose. The official Python tutorial and resources like \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" are great starting points.</Note>\n    <Note>On choosing LLM providers: Most providers now support OpenAI-compatible APIs, meaning code written for one provider often works with others by just changing the base URL. Start with whichever provider offers the best free tier for learning (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or GitHub Models all have generous free tiers as of 2025). You can always switch later.</Note>\n    <Note>About API costs during learning: Free tiers are usually sufficient for learning and small projects. To minimize costs: use cheaper models for experimentation (GPT-4o-mini instead of GPT-4), set max_tokens limits, and cache responses during development. Consider using local models via Ollama for unlimited free experimentation, though they're less capable than cloud models.</Note>\n    <Note>On project scope: These projects are designed to be completable in a week while teaching core concepts. If you finish early, use the twists to explore creative variations. If you're struggling with scope, focus on core functionality first—a simple version that works is better than a complex version that doesn't. You can always enhance it later.</Note>\n    <Note>Regarding the peer-led format: Take advantage of having peers working on similar problems. Share your prompts and discuss what works and what doesn't—prompt engineering improves faster with diverse perspectives. Code review is especially valuable for AI applications since there are often multiple valid approaches.</Note>\n  </Notes>\n</Module>",

You'll learn how to systematically evaluate LLM outputs, optimize prompts through data-driven iteration, and prepare applications for real-world deployment. By building evaluation harnesses and prompt optimization tools, you'll develop the engineering discipline needed to ship reliable AI systems that users can trust. This module bridges the gap between \"it works on my machine\" and \"it works in production.\"</Description>\n\n  <LearningObjectives>\n    <LearningObjective name=\"Systematic LLM Evaluation\">\n      You'll be able to design and implement comprehensive evaluation frameworks for LLM applications, including defining success metrics, creating test datasets, implementing automated evaluation pipelines, and interpreting results to drive improvements.

Research the landscape of evaluation approaches, from traditional NLP metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) to modern LLM-specific metrics (faithfulness, relevance, groundedness). Explore frameworks like DeepEval, RAGAS, and Evidently.\n        \n        Start by reading comparison articles that survey the evaluation landscape, then dive into documentation for 2-3 specific frameworks. Pay attention to: What metrics are available? How do you create test datasets? How do automated metrics correlate with human judgment? What are the tradeoffs between different approaches?\n        \n        If multiple learners tackle this topic, consider dividing by: (1) evaluation metrics and theory, (2) specific framework deep-dives, (3) test dataset creation strategies, (4) human evaluation vs automated evaluation.\n      </Topic>\n      <Topic name=\"Prompt Engineering Techniques and Best Practices\" order=\"2\">\n        Prompt engineering has evolved from an art to a discipline with established patterns and techniques. Research current best practices for 2025, including zero-shot and few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, structured output formatting, role-based prompting, and prompt chaining.\n        \n        Look for authoritative sources like OpenAI's prompt engineering guide, Anthropic's documentation, and academic papers on prompting techniques. Focus on understanding: When does each technique apply? What are the tradeoffs? How do you structure prompts for consistency? How do you handle edge cases?\n        \n        Practice is essential here - don't just read about techniques, try them. Document what works and what doesn't. If splitting this topic, consider: (1) foundational techniques (zero-shot, few-shot), (2) advanced techniques (chain-of-thought, self-consistency), (3) structured output and formatting, (4) prompt chaining and workflows.\n      </Topic>\n      <Topic name=\"Observability and Debugging for LLM Applications\" order=\"3\">\n        Production LLM applications fail in unique ways - they don't crash with stack traces, they just produce bad outputs. Research observability tools and techniques specific to LLM applications, including tracing, logging, monitoring, and debugging approaches.\n        \n        Explore tools like LangSmith, Weights &amp; Biases, Arize Phoenix, and LangFuse. Understand concepts like: distributed tracing for multi-step LLM workflows, prompt and response logging, latency monitoring, cost tracking, quality drift detection, and user feedback loops.\n        \n        Key questions to answer: How do you instrument an LLM application? What should you log? How do you debug when outputs are wrong but the code isn't broken? How do you detect when quality degrades over time? Consider dividing by: (1) tracing and logging strategies, (2) specific observability tools, (3) debugging techniques, (4) production monitoring.\n      </Topic>\n      <Topic name=\"Test Dataset Creation and Management\" order=\"4\">\n        High-quality evaluation requires high-quality test data. Research strategies for creating, managing, and evolving test datasets for LLM applications. This includes manual curation, synthetic generation, sampling from production data, and edge case identification.\n        \n        Look into: How do you create representative test cases? How many test cases do you need? How do you handle the cold start problem (no data yet)? How do you use LLMs to generate test data? How do you version and manage test datasets over time? What's the role of adversarial examples?\n        \n        This topic has both theoretical and practical components. If splitting, consider: (1) test case design principles, (2) synthetic data generation techniques, (3) production data sampling and privacy, (4) dataset management and versioning tools.\n      </Topic>\n      <Topic name=\"Cost Optimization and Token Economics\" order=\"5\">\n        LLM API costs can escalate quickly in production. Research strategies for optimizing costs while maintaining quality, including prompt compression, caching, model selection, batch processing, and fallback strategies.\n        \n        Understand: How are LLM APIs priced? What factors drive cost? How do you measure cost per request or per user? What are strategies for reducing costs without sacrificing quality? When should you use smaller vs larger models? How do you implement caching effectively?\n        \n        Look for real-world case studies and cost analysis. Consider: (1) pricing models and cost drivers, (2) prompt optimization for cost, (3) caching and batching strategies, (4) model selection and routing.\n      </Topic>\n      <Topic name=\"Safety, Hallucination Detection, and Content Filtering\" order=\"6\">\n        Production LLM applications must handle safety concerns, including harmful content generation, hallucinations (factually incorrect outputs), prompt injection attacks, and data leakage. Research detection and mitigation strategies.\n        \n        Explore: How do you detect hallucinations? What are common prompt injection techniques and defenses? How do you implement content filtering? What are the tradeoffs between safety and capability? What tools exist for safety testing?\n        \n        This is critical for any user-facing application. Research both technical solutions (guardrails, content filters) and process solutions (human review, staged rollouts). If splitting: (1) hallucination detection techniques, (2) adversarial prompt defenses, (3) content filtering and moderation, (4) safety testing frameworks.\n      </Topic>\n      <Topic name=\"Production Deployment Patterns for LLM Applications\" order=\"7\">\n        Moving from development to production requires understanding deployment patterns, infrastructure choices, scaling strategies, and operational concerns. Research common architectures and deployment patterns for LLM applications in 2025.\n        \n        Consider: API-based vs self-hosted models, serverless vs container-based deployment, synchronous vs asynchronous processing, rate limiting and throttling, error handling and retries, fallback strategies, and gradual rollouts.\n        \n        Look for architecture diagrams and real-world examples. Understand the tradeoffs between different approaches. If splitting: (1) infrastructure and hosting options, (2) scaling and performance patterns, (3) error handling and reliability, (4) deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, etc.).\n      </Topic>\n    </PrimaryTopics>\n    <StretchTopics count=\"4\">\n      <Topic name=\"Adversarial Testing and Red Teaming for LLM Applications\" order=\"1\"/>\n      <Topic name=\"Multi-Model Orchestration and Routing Strategies\" order=\"2\"/>\n      <Topic name=\"Fine-Tuning vs Prompting: Economics and Decision Framework\" order=\"3\"/>\n      <Topic name=\"Regulatory Compliance and AI Governance for Production Systems\" order=\"4\"/>\n    </StretchTopics>\n  </ResearchTopics>\n\n  <Projects briefs_count=\"2\" twists_count=\"3\">\n    <Briefs count=\"2\">\n      <Brief name=\"LLM Evaluation Harness\" order=\"1\" skills_count=\"4\" examples_count=\"5\" notes_count=\"0\">\n        <Task>Build a comprehensive evaluation system that can test an LLM application across multiple dimensions, track results over time, and provide actionable insights for improvement.</Task>\n        <Focus>Systematic evaluation, automated testing, metrics implementation, test dataset management, and results analysis.

Module 2 builds on that foundation with systematic optimization, production patterns, and reliability engineering.</Note>\n    <Note>The emphasis on \"systematic\" and \"iterative\" reflects 2025 industry best practices. Research shows that continuous optimization compounds significantly over time, with academic studies documenting 156% improvement over 12 months compared to static prompts. Encourage learners to think of prompt engineering as an ongoing discipline, not a one-time task.</Note>\n    <Note>Structured outputs are increasingly critical for production systems. OpenAI's strict mode achieves 100% schema adherence vs. 35% with prompting alone. Help learners understand when to use different approaches: prompt-based for flexibility, function calling for tool integration, strict mode for reliability.</Note>\n    <Note>Cost awareness is essential. LLM applications can become expensive quickly in production. Encourage learners to track costs throughout development, experiment with smaller models where appropriate, and optimize token usage. The best prompt is often the one that achieves acceptable quality at the lowest cost.</Note>\n    <Note>The projects progress in complexity: Prompt Laboratory focuses on systematic experimentation, Structured Data Extractor adds reliability requirements, and Decision Support Agent combines multiple skills in a complex application. Learners can work on projects in parallel based on interest, but encourage completing Prompt Laboratory first as it builds evaluation skills needed for the others.</Note>\n    <Note>The \"twists\" are intentionally conceptual rather than technical. They're designed to make learners think differently about AI behavior and reliability. The Contrarian Advisor encourages critical thinking, The Unreliable Oracle explores uncertainty and confidence, and The Meta-Prompter introduces self-improvement loops. These are stretch goals for learners who finish early.</Note>\n  </Notes>\n</Module>",

  "courseNarrative": "The AI Engineering Apprenticeship is designed to transform experienced developers into skilled AI engineers capable of building production-grade AI applications and integrating AI-enhanced workflows into their daily practice. Over 5 weeks, learners progress through 2 carefully sequenced arcs that build from foundational concepts to advanced implementation and real-world application. The journey begins with establishing core AI engineering skills—prompt engineering, working with LLMs, and understanding AI-assisted development workflows. Learners then advance through building intelligent applications with RAG systems and vector databases.\n\nThis curriculum reflects the current state of the industry in 2025, where AI engineering has emerged as a critical discipline combining software engineering expertise with AI-specific skills. The course emphasizes practical, hands-on learning appropriate for a facilitated structure, with each weekly session building on previous knowledge while allowing learners to immediately apply concepts in their professional work. By focusing on both the engineering fundamentals and the unique challenges of AI systems—such as prompt optimization, handling non-deterministic outputs, cost management, and ethical considerations—learners develop the comprehensive skill set needed to succeed in this rapidly evolving field.",
  "progressionNarrative": "The 2 arcs of this apprenticeship are designed to build progressively more sophisticated AI engineering capabilities. Arc 1 establishes the foundation by teaching learners to work effectively with LLMs through prompt engineering and basic application development. Arc 2 extends these capabilities by introducing knowledge systems through RAG, enabling learners to build applications grounded in proprietary data."
