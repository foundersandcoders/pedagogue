    <Overview>During development, if using Python becomes advantageous (e.g. for an embedding library or PDF parsing), teams might dip their toes in Python here. For instance, a team might write a Python script to pre-process a PDF into text chunks, then use Node to handle the chatbot logic calling the API. This flexible approach builds cross-language savvy gradually. Others might do it all in JS if they find suitable packages.</Overview>
