## 2. Current State
Rhea is an AI-powered curriculum generation platform with two primary workflows: **Metis** (standalone module generation) and **Themis** (multi-module course generation). Following major architectural refactoring in October 2025-10, the codebase now features factories, utilities, and centralized configurations that enable rapid feature development.

### 2.1. Rhea Platform
**Status:** Foundation complete, UI polish ongoing

The platform provides a hub-based navigation structure with module-specific colour palettes and centralized error handling. Recent work focused on establishing reusable patterns for state management (`persistedStore()`), AI client configuration (agent factories), and prompt construction (composable prompt components). Cross-module concerns like British English output and the Theia content exporter remain pending.

### 2.2. Workflow Modules
#### 2.2.1. Themis (Course Builder)
**Completion:** ~60% - Structure complete, generation pending
- âœ… Foundation (hub, types, stores, config form)
- âœ… Arc-based structure planning with thematic organization
- âœ… AI structure generation with web research integration
- âœ… Structure review interface with editable narratives
- âœ… localStorage persistence for auto-save/restore
- ðŸ“‹ Module generation orchestration (6 remaining milestones - critical path)
- ðŸ“‹ Course XML schema and export functionality

**Next:** Module generation workflow (ModuleGenerationList component, course-aware API endpoint, CourseOverview export interface)

#### 2.2.2. Tethys (Arc Designer)
**Status:** Planned - Not yet started

Tethys will provide standalone arc design capabilities outside of full course generation. Currently, arc features are embedded within Themis workflow.

#### 2.2.3. Metis (Module Generator)
**Completion:** ~95% - Feature complete, polish pending
- âœ… Complete module generation workflow with file upload and structured input
- âœ… AI-powered generation with Claude Sonnet 4.5
- âœ… Deep research capability with web search integration
- âœ… XML schema validation with automatic retry logic (max 3 attempts)
- âœ… Changelog and provenance tracking with confidence scoring
- âœ… SSE streaming for progress feedback
- âœ… Intelligent step navigation with automatic advancement
- ðŸ“‹ UI improvements (aesthetic refinement, dark mode)
- ðŸ“‹ Boilerplate module text insertion

**Next:** UI polish and potential integration with Themis course-aware generation

### 2.3. Utility Modules
#### 2.3.1. Theia (Content Preview & Export)
**Status:** Planned - Due 2025-10-22

Reusable content exporter for human-readable previews of generated content. Will support both Themis and Metis output with configurable detail levels and selective export (e.g., export only specific arcs or modules).

#### 2.3.2. Atlas (Atomic Learning Assembler)
**Status:** Planned - Not yet started

Will provide atomic learning unit assembly capabilities for granular curriculum construction.
