  - Call existing module generation logic with course-aware prompts
  - Return XML module spec
  - **Why eighth:** API layer for course-aware module generation
  - **Status:** API structure exists at `/api/themis/generate/`, needs module-specific endpoint
- [ ] 1.9. Extend Module Generation with Course Context 📋 PENDING
  - Modify prompt factories to accept optional course context parameter
  - Include course narrative and progression in prompts when provided
  - Ensure backward compatibility with standalone module generation
  - **Why ninth:** Reuses existing module generation with course awareness
  - **Status:** Prompt factories refactored and ready, needs course context integration
- [ ] 1.10. Build CourseOverview Component (Step 5) 📋 PENDING
  - Create `src/lib/components/themis/CourseOverview.svelte`
  - Display complete course with all generated modules
  - Show course narratives and module summaries
  - Export functionality trigger
  - Final review interface
  - **Why tenth:** Final review and export interface
  - **Status:** Not yet started
- [ ] 1.11. Add Course XML Schema and Validator 📋 PENDING
  - Define course-level XML schema wrapping multiple modules
  - Validation for complete course structure
  - Include course narratives and metadata
  - **Why eleventh:** Ensures exported courses meet quality standards
  - **Status:** Not yet started - will reuse existing validation patterns
- [ ] 1.12. Implement Export Functionality 📋 PENDING
  - XML export for complete course
  - PDF export option (stretch goal)
  - Individual module file exports
  - Course metadata inclusion
  - **Why twelfth:** Delivers the final product to users
  - **Status:** Not yet started

## 4. Work Record
### 4.1. Completed Milestones
- 4.1. Create Hub Dashboard and Navigation Structure ✅ COMPLETED
  - Created hub dashboard at `/` with cards for "Generate Module" and "Generate Course"
  - Moved existing module generator to `/module/new`
  - Added breadcrumb navigation in layout for all routes
  - Hub-based architecture allows parallel workflows
  - **Why first:** Foundation for organizing module vs. course workflows
- 4.2. Create Course Types and Stores ✅ COMPLETED
  - Defined TypeScript interfaces in `src/lib/types/course.ts`
  - CourseData interface with logistics, learners, structure, and modules
  - ModuleSlot interface with status tracking, objectives, topics
  - Created Svelte stores in `src/lib/courseStores.ts`
  - Auto-save to localStorage on course changes
  - Derived stores for computed values (totalModuleWeeks)
  - **Why second:** Type-safe state management for course workflow
- 4.3. Build CourseConfigForm Component (Step 1) ✅ COMPLETED
  - Created `src/lib/course/CourseConfigForm.svelte`
  - Comprehensive form with course identity, logistics, learner configuration
  - Validation for all inputs (weeks, cohort size, dates, etc.)
  - Disabled SSR for localStorage compatibility
  - Reactive statements ensure nested objects exist before access
  - **Why third:** User input collection for course parameters
- 4.4. Build ModuleStructurePlanner Component (Step 2) ✅ COMPLETED
  - Created `src/lib/course/ModuleStructurePlanner.svelte`
  - Visual timeline bar showing proportional week allocation
  - Add/remove modules with validation
  - Auto-suggest feature based on course duration
  - Week budget tracking with overflow detection
  - Module ordering and duration management
  - **Why third:** High-level course structure before AI generation
- 4.5. Create /api/course/structure Endpoint ✅ COMPLETED
  - Created `src/routes/api/course/structure/+server.ts`
  - Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to generate detailed module structure
  - Accepts course parameters and module skeleton
  - Returns course narrative, module objectives/topics, progression narrative
  - Web search tool integration for research
  - **Why third:** AI-powered course structure generation
- 4.6. Build CourseStructureReview Component (Step 3) ✅ COMPLETED
  - Created `src/lib/course/CourseStructureReview.svelte`
  - Auto-generation on component mount
  - Loading state with spinner during 30-60 second generation
  - Error handling with retry functionality
  - Editable course and progression narratives
  - Per-module edit mode with objectives and topics management
  - Regenerate button for fresh AI suggestions
  - Saves refined data back to course store
  - **Why third:** Review and refine AI-generated course structure before module generation
- 4.7. Reimplement the Module Overview Generation Based on Thematic Arcs ✅ COMPLETED
  - Introduced "arcs" as thematic organizational layer between courses and modules
  - Created Arc interface with theme, arcThemeNarrative, and arcProgressionNarrative fields
  - Built ArcStructurePlanner component for defining broad thematic arcs
  - Built ModuleWithinArcPlanner component for organizing modules within arcs (with auto-generate option)
  - Updated API endpoint to handle arc-based course structure generation with AI
  - Updated CourseStructureReview to display collapsible arc hierarchy with nested modules
  - Updated workflow to: Config → Arc Planning → Module Planning → Structure Review → Generation → Export
  - Implemented backward compatibility migration for existing module-only courses
  - Arcs support thematic independence with temporal sequencing
  - **Why completed:** Arcs provide the thematic organizational structure needed for coherent course narratives while maintaining module-level detail
- 4.8. Add localStorage Persistence ✅ COMPLETED
  - Auto-save course progress to localStorage ✅
  - Restore course on page reload ✅
  - "Clear course" functionality ✅
  - Save/load multiple courses ✅
