## 1. Tasks

> [!NOTE]
> This tasklist does not include upcoming [MVP Milestones](docs/dev/roadmap/Themis-MVP.md#2-mvp-milestones)

### 1.1. Open Tasks
#### 1.1.1. Due Tasks

#### 1.1.2. Other Tasks

- [ ] 1.1.2.1. Create a milestoning system in the structure outline
  - 1.1.2.1.1. e.g. "by this module, users should be able to do `xyz`"
- [ ] 1.1.2.2. Replace mandatory arc & modules literal input fields with literal/prompt/undefined input fields
  - 1.1.2.2.1. currently, required fields are inserted into the final output as literals
  - 1.1.2.2.2. this requires the user to already know what they want; more importantly, the AI model uses this input to generate content
  - 1.1.2.2.3. this undermines a core purpose of the app: curriculum generation by non-experts
  - 1.1.2.2.4. required inputs should be given three options:
    - 1.1.2.2.4.1. the existing literal value (e.g. "use exactly this input as the module name")
    - 1.1.2.2.4.2. a prompt value (e.g. "generate a module name based on my input")
    - 1.1.2.2.4.3. an undefined value ("use the content of the previous module, subsequent module and parent arc to generate a coherent module name")
- [ ] 1.1.2.3. Ensure "suggest structure" respects time constraints
- [ ] 1.1.2.4. Create "progression type" option
  - 1.1.2.4.1. This can apply at the `course -> arc` level and/or the `arc -> module` level
  - 1.1.2.4.2. It defines the relationship between sibling-level content within a parent unit
  - 1.1.2.4.3. Types include:
    - 1.1.2.4.3.1. **Sequential:** `parent[x].unit[x]` directly builds on knowledge acquired in `parent[x].unit[x-1]`
    - 1.1.2.4.3.2. **Progressive:** `parent[x].unit[x]` does not necessarily directly build on knowledge acquired in `parent[x].unit[x-1]`, but is more advanced on average
    - 1.1.2.4.3.3. **Parallel:** `parent[x].unit[x]` does not directly build on knowledge acquired in `parent[x].unit[x-1]`; it tackles an alternate approach or parallel aspect to the focus of `parent[x]`
- [ ] 1.1.2.5. Allow "invisible" arcs
  - 1.1.2.5.1. Arcs can be defined as consisting of exactly 1 module each
  - 1.1.2.5.2. In this scenario, the UI should obscure any reference to Arcs whilst still preserving them in the data structure
- [ ] 1.1.2.6. Timeout values (`src/routes/api/themis/module/+server.ts:52`) should be extracted to constants
- [ ] 1.1.2.9. Fix Race Condition in SSE Stream Cleanup
  - 1.1.2.9.1. In `ModuleGenerationList.svelte:160-162`, the reader is removed from `activeReaders` in a `finally` block but, if `onDestroy` runs concurrently with a completing stream, the `reader.cancel()` call might fail or leave streams in an inconsistent state.
- [ ] 1.1.2.10. Fix SSE Parsing Vulnerability
  - 1.1.2.10.1. `JSON.parse(line.slice(6))` will throw if the server sends malformed JSON. This could crash the entire generation flow.
- [ ] 1.1.2.11. Fix Missing Error Handling in `generateAll`
  - 1.1.2.11.1. Line 265-267: The function continues generating after errors without checking if a critical failure occurred.
  - 1.1.2.11.2. If the API endpoint is down, it will attempt to generate all remaining modules.
- [ ] 1.1.2.12. Create a more elegant module generation flow
  - 1.1.2.12.1. The `generateAll` function (line 261) generates modules sequentially with await
  - 1.1.2.12.2. For courses with many modules, this could take hours.
  - 1.1.2.12.3. We need to concoct a way of preserving sequential coherence whilst reducing this burden
  - 1.1.2.12.4. One approach could be to begin generating `module[x]` after the initial overview details of `module[x-1]` are completed but before the detailed Project Briefs etc have completed
- [ ] 1.1.2.13. Optimise `ModuleGenerationList` Re-render
  - 1.1.2.13.1. Each store update triggers re-render of the entire ModuleGenerationList. With 20+ modules, this could feel sluggish.
  - 1.1.2.13.2. We could use `{#key moduleId}` blocks or extract `ModuleCard` to a separate component with `export let module` to leverage Svelte's granular reactivity.
- [ ] 1.1.2.14. Improve handling of bullet lists within modules in `CourseOverview`
- [ ] 1.1.2.15. Improve text displayed in "Phase 3: Module Planning"
  - 1.1.2.15.1. ![screenshot of phase 3](assets/screenshots/themis-module-planning.jpg)
- [ ] 1.1.2.15. Improve text layout in "Phase 4: Structure Review"
  - 1.1.2.15.1. ![screenshot of phase 4](assets/screenshots/themis-structure-review.jpg)
- [ ] 1.1.2.16. In "Phase 4: Structure Review", make module previews toggle elements
- [ ] 1.1.2.17. Allow user to define requirements (as in Metis)
  - 1.1.2.17.1. This should be definable per Course (Themis), per Arc (Tethys) and per Module (Metis)
- [ ] 1.1.2.18. Allow multiple toggles to be open/closed without being affected by siblings

### 1.2. Blocked Tasks

---

## 2. MVP Milestones

- [ ] 2.1. Radically improve module-to-module coherence at generation
  - 2.1.1. **IMPORTANT:** confer with user to understand requirements
  - 2.1.2. Insert interstitial step: generating module overviews first, allowing later generation of full module spec
  - 2.1.3. Cumulatively build a reference snipped on what learners will already know by the time a module starts, then pass that snippet to Metis
  - 2.1.4. Separate all prompt snippets into separate files for increased visibility to devs
- [ ] 2.2. Add Course XML Schema and Validator ðŸ“‹ PENDING
  - Define course-level XML schema wrapping multiple modules
  - Validation for complete course structure
  - Include course narratives and metadata
  - **Why eleventh:** Ensures exported courses meet quality standards
  - **Status:** Not yet started - will reuse existing validation patterns
  - **Note:** Current export uses Theia service which handles course-to-markdown/HTML conversion
- [ ] 2.3. Implement Export Functionality ðŸ“‹ PENDING
  - XML export for complete course
  - PDF export option (stretch goal)
  - Individual module file exports
  - Course metadata inclusion
  - **Why twelfth:** Delivers the final product to users
  - **Status:** Partially complete - Theia export service operational, needs XML course schema

- [ ] 3.2. Course templates library
- [ ] 3.3. Import existing courses for modification
- [ ] 3.4. Collaborative course editing (multi-user)
- [ ] 3.5. Version comparison for courses
