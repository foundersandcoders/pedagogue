![Pedagogue](./static/github-header-banner.png)

An AI-powered curriculum generation tool for peer-led learning cohorts. Pedagogue uses Claude AI with optional web research to generate comprehensive, up-to-date module specifications and complete multi-week courses.

## What Pedagogue Does

Pedagogue generates curriculum materials in two ways:

### Module Generator

Create standalone module specifications with:
- Learning objectives and module overview
- Detailed project briefs with examples and success criteria
- Research topics with guidance for learners
- Additional skills categorized by importance
- Project "twists" to add interesting challenges

### Course Builder

Create complete multi-week courses with:
- Thematic arcs organizing related modules
- Learning progression across modules
- Course-level narratives and structure
- Individual module generation (coming soon)

**Key value:** Pedagogue can use web search to ensure your curriculum reflects current industry practices and technologies, not just what Claude knew at training time.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/foundersandcoders/pedagogue.git
cd pedagogue

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxx

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** to start using Pedagogue.

**See [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started.md) for detailed installation and usage instructions.**

## Cost Information

- Claude Sonnet 4.5 pricing: ~¬£2.20/million input tokens, ~¬£11/million output tokens
- Typical module generation: **¬£0.15-¬£0.30** (with research enabled)
- Course structure generation: **¬£0.10-¬£0.20**
- New Anthropic accounts often include free credits

## Key Features

### üìù Change Tracking & Provenance

Every generated module includes comprehensive change tracking to support the **cascade pattern** - where AI-generated modules are updated iteratively whilst maintaining human oversight:

- **Automatic Changelog**: Documents what changed, why, and with what confidence level
- **Confidence Scoring**: High/medium/low confidence flags help reviewers prioritize
- **Research Citations**: Web research sources automatically cited
- **Provenance Tracking**: Shows when generated, by which model, flags sections needing review

This enables curriculum councils to:
- Quickly identify what's been updated since last version
- Focus review time on low-confidence changes
- Understand rationale behind AI-proposed updates
- Track sections needing human review

See [Changelog Schema Design](/docs/changelog-schema-design.md) for technical details.

### üî¨ Deep Research Capability

Enable web search during generation to:
- Verify technologies/practices are current
- Update recommendations based on industry trends
- Search trusted domains: vendor docs, GitHub, Stack Overflow, academic sources
- Cite sources for transparency

**This is the core value** - without research, you're just reformatting existing content.

### ‚úÖ Schema Validation

All generated modules automatically validated against requirements:
- Minimum 3 module objectives
- Minimum 5 primary research topics
- Minimum 2 project briefs with detailed criteria
- Automatic retry (up to 3 attempts) if validation fails

### üé® Two Workflow Modes

**Module Generator** - Quick standalone modules
1. Upload XML inputs (projects, skills, research)
2. Provide structured context
3. Generate with optional research
4. Download XML specification

**Course Builder** - Complete multi-week courses
1. Configure course identity and logistics
2. Plan thematic arcs
3. Organize modules within arcs
4. AI generates detailed structure
5. Review and refine
6. Generate individual modules (coming soon)

## Input File Format

Pedagogue accepts XML files for module inputs. Each file must have a specific root element:

### projects.xml
```xml
<Projects>
  <ProjectBriefs>
    <ProjectBrief>
      <Overview>
        <Name>Project Name</Name>
        <Task>What learners will build</Task>
        <Focus>Key technologies and techniques</Focus>
      </Overview>
      <Criteria>Success criteria as bullet points</Criteria>
      <Skills>
        <Skill>
          <Name>Skill Name</Name>
          <Details>What learners will learn</Details>
        </Skill>
      </Skills>
      <Examples>
        <Example>
          <Name>Example Name</Name>
          <Description>Brief description</Description>
        </Example>
