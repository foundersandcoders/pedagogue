    <ModuleDescription>
      This module explores how AI systems can access, process, and act upon information beyond their training data. Learners will build user-facing chatbots that handle long documents and autonomous agents that use external tools to accomplish multi-step tasks. Through hands-on projects, participants will master techniques for extending AI capabilities through retrieval, tool integration, and reasoning frameworks while confronting real-world challenges like context limits, API integration, and user experience design.

  <ResearchTopics>
    <PrimaryTopics>
      <PrimaryTopic>
        Long-Context Models and Their Capabilities: Research what models are available that can handle large inputs, focusing on Anthropic's Claude (100k+ token context), GPT-4 Turbo (128k context), and Google's Gemini (up to 1M tokens). Investigate their pricing, accessibility with available API keys, and practical limitations. Start by reading the official documentation for each provider, then look for benchmark comparisons and real-world case studies. If multiple learners tackle this, divide by provider (one person researches Claude, another GPT-4, another Gemini) or by use case (one focuses on cost analysis, another on performance benchmarks, another on implementation examples).
      </PrimaryTopic>

      <PrimaryTopic>
        Text Chunking and Document Processing Strategies: Explore techniques for breaking large documents into manageable pieces while preserving meaning and context. Research recursive summarization (summarizing sections then summarizing summaries), semantic chunking (splitting by topic boundaries), and fixed-size chunking with overlap. Investigate libraries like LangChain's text splitters, Python's NLTK, or JavaScript alternatives. Start with blog posts about chunking strategies, then examine library documentation and GitHub examples. Divide work by exploring different chunking approaches, document formats (PDF vs HTML vs plain text), or programming language implementations.
      </PrimaryTopic>

      <PrimaryTopic>
        Embeddings and Semantic Search Fundamentals: Understand how text embeddings enable semantic similarity search. Research OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model, open-source alternatives like Sentence-BERT or Instructor-XL, and the mathematics behind cosine similarity. Experiment with converting sample texts to embeddings and calculating similarity scores. Start with OpenAI's embeddings guide, then explore Hugging Face's sentence-transformers library. If dividing the work, one person could focus on commercial embedding APIs (costs, speed, quality), another on open-source models, and another on building a simple similarity search prototype.
      </PrimaryTopic>

      <PrimaryTopic>
        AI Agent Frameworks and Function Calling: Investigate frameworks that enable AI agents to use tools, focusing on LangChain's agent abstractions, OpenAI's function calling API, and Anthropic's tool use. Research the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) prompting pattern and how it enables multi-step task completion. Start with OpenAI's function calling documentation and LangChain's agent quickstart. Look for examples of agents using search tools, calculators, or API calls. Divide by framework (LangChain vs raw function calling), by tool type (search vs computation vs data access), or by exploring different agent architectures (zero-shot vs few-shot vs conversational).
      </PrimaryTopic>

      <PrimaryTopic>
        Practical API Integration and Error Handling: Research how to integrate external APIs into AI workflows, focusing on weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap), search APIs (Serper, Brave Search), and data sources. Learn about API authentication, rate limiting, parsing JSON responses, and handling failures gracefully. Investigate how to structure code that bridges between LLM outputs and API calls. Start by selecting one API and reading its documentation, then look for integration examples in AI projects on GitHub. Divide work by API type (search vs data vs computation), by programming language (Python vs JavaScript), or by focusing on different aspects (authentication, error handling, response parsing).
      </PrimaryTopic>

      <PrimaryTopic>
        PDF and Document Parsing Tools: Identify libraries and techniques for extracting text from PDFs, Word documents, and web pages. Research Python options like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, and python-docx, as well as JavaScript alternatives like pdf-parse or Mozilla's PDF.js. Investigate challenges like handling scanned PDFs (OCR requirements), preserving document structure, and extracting tables or images. Start with library documentation and comparison articles, then test tools on sample documents. Divide by document type (PDF vs DOCX vs HTML), by programming language, or by complexity (simple text extraction vs structure preservation vs multimodal content).
      </PrimaryTopic>

      <PrimaryTopic>
        Preventing Hallucinations and Ensuring Accuracy: Research strategies to make AI systems cite sources, indicate uncertainty, and avoid fabricating information. Investigate prompt patterns like "If you don't find an answer in the provided documents, say 'I don't know'", techniques for extracting citations, and methods for evaluating factual accuracy. Look into grounding techniques and retrieval-augmented generation principles. Start with research papers on hallucination reduction and blog posts about prompt engineering for accuracy. Divide by technique (prompt engineering vs retrieval grounding vs post-processing verification), by evaluation methods (human eval vs automated metrics), or by exploring different model behaviors.
      </PrimaryTopic>

      <PrimaryTopic>
        Conversational Context Management: Explore techniques for maintaining context across multi-turn conversations, including conversation summarization, sliding window approaches, and persistent memory patterns. Research how ChatGPT and Claude handle long conversations and what strategies work best for different use cases. Investigate storing conversation history in databases versus keeping it in-prompt. Start with documentation on chat completion APIs and articles about conversation design. Divide by approach (summarization vs windowing vs external memory), by implementation (in-memory vs database-backed), or by use case (short-term chat vs long-term user relationships).

  <Notes>
    This module serves as a bridge between basic LLM API usage and more advanced AI engineering concepts. The projects are designed to be achievable within a 3-week timeframe while introducing fundamental concepts that will be expanded in later modules. The Knowledge and Memory project provides a gentler introduction to retrieval concepts before a dedicated RAG module, while the User Agent project introduces autonomous systems and tool use that can be expanded into more complex multi-agent architectures later. Teams should be encouraged to start simple and iterate, focusing on getting a working system before adding complexity. The research topics are structured to support both projects, with some topics more relevant to one project than the other, allowing teams to focus their research based on their chosen brief. The additional skills are presented as optional enhancements rather than requirements, giving teams flexibility to use their existing language preferences while providing pathways to expand their toolkit where beneficial.
