### 8.3. Usage Suggestions
#### 8.3.1. Safer core “classroom‑friendly” pool (lowest controversy)
Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Euclid, Pythagoras, Hipparchus, Archimedes, Democritus, Anaximander, Heraclitus, Chrysippus, Carneades, Cicero, Lucretius, Varro.

#### 8.3.2. Use‑with‑care (context‑sensitive or easily misunderstood)
Mani, Mazdak (strong religious/communal doctrines); Zoroaster (religious founder); Anselm/Aquinas/Maimonides/Saadia (explicitly theological—fine in universities, check policy in schools); Epicurus (hedonism often misread; frame as tranquillity).

### 8.4. Naming hygiene
- Pick **one transliteration**: **Averroes** *or* **Ibn Rushd**; **Avicenna** *or* **Ibn Sina**.
- Prefer **unique initials** per module to avoid collisions (e.g., A=Aristotle for Ontology; E=Euclid for Assessment).
- Drop diacritics in service IDs (e.g., `hipparchia-forum`).
- Do a quick check for **local sensitivities** (school type, faith context) before finalising.
